# Encrypt and Decrypt directory with RC4
This project was just a test to see how ChatGPT could help build a project.  
I do not suggest you use it seriously, there isn't much error handling.  
But it did do good when I had tested it on test directories with many files.  
######
With this tool you can encrypt a directory recursively with a special password.  
It will also leave a note in the directory with a specified filename & message.   
It excludes ".ini" files and has an option to skip files if they are too large.  
###### 
If you want to not depend on the .dll after it is built.  
You can use Costura Fody to embed it into the project.
